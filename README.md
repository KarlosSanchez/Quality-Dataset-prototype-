This proposal, titled “Prototype for Dataset Processing Using Python”, focuses on developing 
a prototype that enables the verification of dataset to detect potential anomalies that could 
impact the performance of Machine Learning algorithms. The prototype seeks to identify 
common problems in the data, such as: missing values, non-categorical variables, and data 
imbalances. The prototype will allow the visualization of these cases and will offer alternatives 
to solve dataset anomalies; in this way, after the analysis process, a corrected dataset is 
generated, which can be used in Machine Learning experiments with greater reliability.

Keywords: Prototype, dataset, machine learning, Quality Data, Verification of dataset, 
Python, Potential anomalies in the dataset.
